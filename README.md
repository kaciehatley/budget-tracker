## <a name="overview"></a>Project Overview
This budget tracker can be utilized by any user wishing to keep track of their expenses. By adding or subtracting funds, you see all transactions displayed on a graph. This application functions as a PWA (Progressive Web Application) allowing the user to make transaction on and offline.
